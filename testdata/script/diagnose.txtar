# This means that any change in how gofumpt reports its own version
# will require two pull requests, the second one updating the test script.
# We could consider using go-internal/goproxytest, but then we would need to
# manually run something like go-internal/cmd/txtar-addmod reguarly.
# Or teach goproxytest to serve a mock version of gofumpt from its local checkout.
# Either way, both are relatively overkill for now.
# Update this pseudo-version to master from time to time as needed.
