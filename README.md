# gofumpt

	GO111MODULE=on go get mvdan.cc/gofumpt

Enforce a stricter format than `gofmt`, while being backwards compatible. That
is, `gofumpt` is happy with a subset of the formats that `gofmt` is happy with.

The tool is a modified fork of `gofmt`, so it can be used as a drop-in
replacement. Running `gofmt` after `gofumpt` should be a no-op.

A drop-in replacement for `goimports` is also available:

	GO111MODULE=on go get mvdan.cc/gofumpt/gofumports

Most of the Go source files in this repository belong to the Go project.
The added formatting rules are in the `format` package.

### Added rules

No empty lines at the beginning or end of a function

<details><summary><i>example</i></summary>

```
func foo() {
	println("bar")

}
```

```
func foo() {
	println("bar")
}
```

</details>

No empty lines around a lone statement (or comment) in a block

<details><summary><i>example</i></summary>

```
if err != nil {

	return err
}
```

```
if err != nil {
	return err
}
```

</details>

No empty lines before a simple error check

<details><summary><i>example</i></summary>

```
foo, err := processFoo()

if err != nil {
	return err
}
```

```
foo, err := processFoo()
if err != nil {
	return err
}
```

</details>

Composite literals should use newlines consistently

<details><summary><i>example</i></summary>

```
// A newline before or after an element requires newlines for the opening and
// closing braces.
var ints = []int{1, 2,
	3, 4}

// A newline between consecutive elements requires a newline between all
// elements.
var matrix = [][]int{
	{1},
	{2}, {
		3,
	},
}
```

```
var ints = []int{
	1, 2,
	3, 4,
}

var matrix = [][]int{
	{1},
	{2},
	{
		3,
	},
}
```

</details>

`std` imports must be in a separate group at the top

<details><summary><i>example</i></summary>

```
import (
	"foo.com/bar"

	"io"

	"io/ioutil"
)
```

```
import (
	"io"
	"io/ioutil"

	"foo.com/bar"
)
```

</details>

Short case clauses should take a single line

<details><summary><i>example</i></summary>

```
switch c {
case 'a', 'b',
	'c', 'd':
}
```

```
switch c {
case 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd':
}
```

</details>

Multiline top-level declarations must be separated by empty lines

<details><summary><i>example</i></summary>

```
func foo() {
	println("multiline foo")
}
func bar() {
	println("multiline bar")
}
```

```
func foo() {
	println("multiline foo")
}

func bar() {
	println("multiline bar")
}
```

</details>

Single var declarations should not be grouped with parentheses

<details><summary><i>example</i></summary>

```
var (
	foo = "bar"
)
```

```
var foo = "bar"
```

</details>

Contiguous top-level declarations should be grouped together

<details><summary><i>example</i></summary>

```
var nicer = "x"
var with = "y"
var alignment = "z"
```

```
var (
	nicer     = "x"
	with      = "y"
	alignment = "z"
)
```

</details>


Simple var-declaration statements should use short assignments

<details><summary><i>example</i></summary>

```
var s = "somestring"
```

```
s := "somestring"
```

</details>


The `-s` code simplification flag is enabled by default

<details><summary><i>example</i></summary>

```
var _ = [][]int{[]int{1}}
```

```
var _ = [][]int{{1}}
```

</details>


Octal integer literals should use the `0o` prefix on modules using Go 1.13 and later

<details><summary><i>example</i></summary>

```
const perm = 0755
```

```
const perm = 0o755
```

</details>

Comments which aren't Go directives should start with a whitespace

<details><summary><i>example</i></summary>

```
//go:noinline

//Foo is awesome.
func Foo() {}
```

```
//go:noinline

// Foo is awesome.
func Foo() {}
```

</details>

#### Extra rules behind `-extra`

Adjacent parameters with the same type should be grouped together

<details><summary><i>example</i></summary>

```
func Foo(bar string, baz string) {}
```

```
func Foo(bar, baz string) {}
```

</details>

### Installation

`gofumpt` is a replacement for `gofmt`, so you can simply `go get` it as
described at the top of this README and use it.

Alternatively, to use the tool with VS Code, add the following setting:

```
"go.formatTool": "gofumports",
```

This setting must be modified through the JSON file, there is no way of doing
this change in the UI, as it's a selector and not a textbox. For this reason,
VS Code will complain about an invalid setting value. You can safely ignore
this warning, the correct tool will be used even if VS Code says the opposite.

You can use `gofumpt` instead of `gofumports` if you don't need auto-importing
on-save. This setting only works with the Go language server disabled, as
formatting is completely bypassed and delegated to `gopls` if enabled.

### Roadmap

This tool is a place to experiment. In the long term, the features that work
well might be proposed for `gofmt` itself.

The tool is also compatible with `gofmt` and is aimed to be stable, so you can
rely on it for your code as long as you pin a version of it.

### License

Note that much of the code is copied from Go's `gofmt` and `goimports` commands.
You can tell which files originate from the Go repository from their copyright
headers. Their license file is `LICENSE.google`.

`gofumpt`'s original source files are also under the 3-clause BSD license, with
the separate file `LICENSE`.
