# gofumpt

	GO111MODULE=on go get mvdan.cc/gofumpt

Enforce a stricter format than `gofmt`, while being backwards compatible. That
is, `gofumpt` is happy with a subset of the formats that `gofmt` is happy with.

The tool is a modified fork of `gofmt`, so it can be used as a drop-in
replacement. Running `gofmt` after `gofumpt` should be a no-op. For example:

	gofumpt -l -w .

Most of the Go source files in this repository belong to the Go project.
The added formatting rules are in the `format` package.

### Added rules

No empty lines at the beginning or end of a function

<details><summary><i>example</i></summary>

```
func foo() {
	println("bar")

}
```

```
func foo() {
	println("bar")
}
```

</details>

No empty lines around a lone statement (or comment) in a block

<details><summary><i>example</i></summary>

```
if err != nil {

	return err
}
```

```
if err != nil {
	return err
}
```

</details>

No empty lines before a simple error check

<details><summary><i>example</i></summary>

```
foo, err := processFoo()

if err != nil {
	return err
}
```

```
foo, err := processFoo()
if err != nil {
	return err
}
```

</details>

Composite literals should use newlines consistently

<details><summary><i>example</i></summary>

```
// A newline before or after an element requires newlines for the opening and
// closing braces.
var ints = []int{1, 2,
	3, 4}

// A newline between consecutive elements requires a newline between all
// elements.
var matrix = [][]int{
	{1},
	{2}, {
		3,
	},
}
```

```
var ints = []int{
	1, 2,
	3, 4,
}

var matrix = [][]int{
	{1},
	{2},
	{
		3,
	},
}
```

</details>

Empty field lists should use a single line

<details><summary><i>example</i></summary>

```
var V interface {
} = 3

type T struct {
}

func F(
)
```

```
var V interface{} = 3

type T struct{}

func F()
```

</details>

`std` imports must be in a separate group at the top

<details><summary><i>example</i></summary>

```
import (
	"foo.com/bar"

	"io"

	"io/ioutil"
)
```

```
import (
	"io"
	"io/ioutil"

	"foo.com/bar"
)
```

</details>

Short case clauses should take a single line

<details><summary><i>example</i></summary>

```
switch c {
case 'a', 'b',
	'c', 'd':
}
```

```
switch c {
case 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd':
}
```

</details>

Multiline top-level declarations must be separated by empty lines

<details><summary><i>example</i></summary>

```
func foo() {
	println("multiline foo")
}
func bar() {
	println("multiline bar")
}
```

```
func foo() {
	println("multiline foo")
}

func bar() {
	println("multiline bar")
}
```

</details>

Single var declarations should not be grouped with parentheses

<details><summary><i>example</i></summary>

```
var (
	foo = "bar"
)
```

```
var foo = "bar"
```

</details>

Contiguous top-level declarations should be grouped together

<details><summary><i>example</i></summary>

```
var nicer = "x"
var with = "y"
var alignment = "z"
```

```
var (
	nicer     = "x"
	with      = "y"
	alignment = "z"
)
```

</details>


Simple var-declaration statements should use short assignments

<details><summary><i>example</i></summary>

```
var s = "somestring"
```

```
s := "somestring"
```

</details>


The `-s` code simplification flag is enabled by default

<details><summary><i>example</i></summary>

```
var _ = [][]int{[]int{1}}
```

```
var _ = [][]int{{1}}
```

</details>


Octal integer literals should use the `0o` prefix on modules using Go 1.13 and later

<details><summary><i>example</i></summary>

```
const perm = 0755
```

```
const perm = 0o755
```

</details>

Comments which aren't Go directives should start with a whitespace

<details><summary><i>example</i></summary>

```
//go:noinline

//Foo is awesome.
func Foo() {}
```

```
//go:noinline

// Foo is awesome.
func Foo() {}
```

</details>

#### Extra rules behind `-extra`

Adjacent parameters with the same type should be grouped together

<details><summary><i>example</i></summary>

```
func Foo(bar string, baz string) {}
```

```
func Foo(bar, baz string) {}
```

</details>

### Installation

`gofumpt` is a replacement for `gofmt`, so you can simply `go get` it as
described at the top of this README and use it.

When using an IDE or editor with Go integrations, it's best to use `gofumpt` as
part of `gopls`. The instructions below show how to do that for some of the
major editors out there.

#### Visual Studio Code

Enable the language server following [the official docs](https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/doc/vscode.md),
and then enable gopls's `gofumpt` option. Note that VS Code will complain about
the `gopls` settings, but they will still work.

```json
"go.useLanguageServer": true,
"gopls": {
	"formatting.gofumpt": true,
},
```

#### Goland

Once `gofumpt` is installed, follow the steps below:

- Open **Settings** (File > Settings)
- Open the **Tools** section
- Find the *File Watchers* sub-section
- Click on the `+` on the right side to add a new file watcher
- Choose *Custom Template*

When a window asks for settings, you can enter the following:

* File Types: Select all .go files
* Scope: Project Files
* Program: Select your `gofumpt` executable
* Arguments: `-w $FilePath$`
* Output path to refresh: `$FilePath$`
* Working directory: `$ProjectFileDir$`
* Environment variables: `GOROOT=$GOROOT$;GOPATH=$GOPATH$;PATH=$GoBinDirs$`

To avoid unecessary runs, you should disable all checkboxes in the *Advanced* section.

#### Vim-go

Ensure you are at least running version
[v1.24](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v124---september-15-2020),
and set up `gopls` for formatting code with `gofumpt`:

```vim
let g:go_fmt_command="gopls"
let g:go_gopls_gofumpt=1
```

#### Govim

With a [new enough version of govim](https://github.com/govim/govim/pull/1005),
simply configure `gopls` to use `gofumpt`:

```vim
call govim#config#Set("Gofumpt", 1)
```

### Roadmap

This tool is a place to experiment. In the long term, the features that work
well might be proposed for `gofmt` itself.

The tool is also compatible with `gofmt` and is aimed to be stable, so you can
rely on it for your code as long as you pin a version of it.

### License

Note that much of the code is copied from Go's `gofmt` command. You can tell
which files originate from the Go repository from their copyright headers. Their
license file is `LICENSE.google`.

`gofumpt`'s original source files are also under the 3-clause BSD license, with
the separate file `LICENSE`.
